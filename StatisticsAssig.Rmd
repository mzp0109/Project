### Question 1.

My project is to study the plant variability impact on soybean yield in Alabama.

The objectives of my project are: 

1.	Asses the soybean canopy plant-to-plant variability in the field.
2.	Evaluate how this variability among plants in the same sowing row can impact soybean grain yield. 

For that, we conducted a statewide assessment of plant in the field. The data was collected from commercial soybean fields around Alabama. For each field, 10 consecutive plants were collected in 3 distinct points within the field. The final data consists of the mean value for the 10 plants. To measure the variability among plants, I am using the standard deviation within the 10 plants collected per point.
The data I am using for my project consists of plant growth parameters such as:

-	Plant height (cm)
-	Number of pods per plant
-	Number of lateral branches per plant
And grain yield production expressed as:
-	Seed weight per plant (g)

My hypothesis is that non-uniform canopy among consecutive plants in the same sowing row can cause yield loss. While uniform plants can avoid yield losses.

To test my hypothesis, I will use the following statistical methods:

-	Descriptive Statistic (Mean, Minimum, Maximum, Median)
-	Pearsonâ€™s Correlation Test
-	Linear Model

### Question 3.

For the descriptive statistics:
In Alabama fields, we had an average of soybean plants with 72.6 cm height, 43 pods per plant, 2 lateral branches, and seed weight per plant of 12.1 grams.

In Alabama fields, we can see a variability in soybean height ranging from 1.9 to 16.2 cm, with an average of 6 cm between plants. Number of pods per plants can variate from 3 to 47.7, with an average of varibility of 16.76 pods per plant. Branches variates from 0 to 3 between plants, with an average of 1 branch variability. Finally, the seed weight between plants can range from 0.6 to 23.3 grams with an average of variability 4.7 grams.

For the correlations:
The plant height is significantly correlated to the number of pods per plant and seed weight per plant. Taller plants results in more pods and more yielding.
Number of pods per plant is significantly correlated to the number of lateral branches and seed weight per plant. More lateral branches results in more pods and yielding per plant.
Also, number of lateral branches has a significant effect on the seed weight per plant.

Higher the variability in number of lateral branches and pods between plants, higher the variability in yielding per plant. Therefore, lateral branches and number of pods play a significant role in uniformity of the plant canopy and therefore they are the factors that could most interfere in grain yield.
